# Personal-Emacs-Config
My emacs config is more of a backup.

A while ago GitHub shut down the Atom text editor in favour of VSCode, I personally like VSCode but it has recently been going in directions I do not like and I realised I needed a backup plan if VSCode becomes a bloated mess. I started working on this config on July 7, 2024, currently, this is not usable yet and is still under development.
